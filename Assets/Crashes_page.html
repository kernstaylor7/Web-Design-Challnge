        Comparing the three bar graphs, at first glance you could be led to believe that in the 70s-80s and the 2000s that the plane crashes were consistent and high.  In truth, the 2000s is higher than the early 1900s, but not on the scale of the 70s-80s era. Each bar graph is on its own scale based off the highest number of crashes. In the early 1900s, the highest number of crashes did not even hit the 20s in a single year.  In the early 2000s, that number was more than doubled being close to 50 in the highest number of crashes.  Nothing quiet compares to the 1970s and 80s however with the peak of crashes being rough 80 plane crashes in a single year.  Why was it so high you may ask?  Based off our hypothesis, it could be due to how new commercial flying was as a form of mainstream travel.  Lack of emergency situational trainings, lack of security, and less sophisticated technology left that era in time at a higher risk of anything that could go wrong on a flight.  Such as, but not limited to: mechanical failures, unpreparedness in emergency situations, human error, or even hijackings.  It was our hypothesis that the time before, there were far fewer planes in the air.  The time after had the advantage of lessons learned to  lessen the likelihood of the tragic events that from a higher frequency than the early years of commercial travel.
