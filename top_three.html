            <p>The Junker F 13 was the first all metal plane enclosed for passenger transport.  Developed in Germany at the end of WWI, it can easily be said that this plane was a trailblazer or considered a prototype for its design.  In the crashes reported, most of the reasons were unknow, but known crashes were related to: weather, pilot error, or engine failure. </p>
            <p>Breguet 14 was a French designed war plane used in WWI.  It knew a lengthy career in the military being used in 10 other countries but also was commonly used an international mail carrier after the war. Like the Junker 13, more crashes were caused by forces unknown, but there were almost as many weather related and mechanical malfunctions.  </p> 
            <p>The De Havilland DH had the highest rate of crashes as displayed above by a large majority.  Much like the Breguet 14, was used for both military and postal services.  Based off the analysis of what caused the crashes, most of the crashes incurred during day incurring poor weather.  </p>
            <p>Based off of the three planes and a brief review of their flight usage, it can be assumed that postal was a riskier use for flight.  Reasons postal carrier planes were at higher risk of crashing could be the longer flight paths, difficulty predicting weather patterns, and overall rate of usage.  </p>

        <h3>Midway </h3>
              <p>The Antonov AN was developed in the SSR as the largest cargo plane of its era.  Though it’s the lesser of the three to see tragedy  in its decade, it saw almost as many crashes due to human error as weather related crashed.</p>
            <p>Also developed by the SSR, the Ilyushin saw about 20% more crashes than its counterpart.  It was built to replace the Antonov but used in passenger travel.  The Ilyushin more crashes due to human error with mechanical being a close second. </p> 
            <p>The rate of highest for crashes goes to the McDonnel Douglas, a plane manufactured in the United States until the mid-80s.  Although human error has been an increased cause of crashes through this decade, it contributes to an astonishing 50% plus.  We are also introduced to acts of terror causes crashes in the form of on board bombs and flight hijackings. </p></body>

        <h3>Latest</h3>
            <p>Fascinatingly and/or disturbingly enough, the same three planes are responsible for the highest amount of crashes in this decade span as the previous. The Antonov saw a steep increase of mechanical errors that were the causation of about 40% of the crashes.  Human error and weather being another 40% combined, both being responsible for 20% individually.  There was a new category introduced, instead of human error, clear negligence came in as a factor.  Two flights were found to have intoxicated pilots flying the planes.  </p>            
            <p>The McDonnel Douglas did not see a spike in any particular reason for in flight crashes except for a slight higher rate of human error vs weather/mechanical/or unknown causes.  There was also combined factors such as a combinations of either human error/weather or human error/mechanical errors that caused the planes to crash that the scenarios seemed to feed off each other.  In the crash description, they were described as situations that if each happened alone, the flight would have continued safely, but poor reactions to weather or mechanical errors caused the flights to crash which would not had happened if one did not have the other. This was a very slight number of crash causations, but again, a new factor contributing to the overall numbers. </p>
            <p>The Ilyushin’s rates of crashes were primarily from human error and mechanical failings.  Unknown causes, weather, and terrorism all played a factor in the plane’s rate of crashes, but were very low in comparison to human error and mechanical errors. </p>
